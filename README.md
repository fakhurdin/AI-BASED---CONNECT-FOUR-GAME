# 🧠 AI-Based Connect Four Game

A Python-based version of the classic Connect Four game enhanced with an AI opponent. The game utilizes the **Minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta pruning** to create a competitive and intelligent gameplay experience.

## 🎮 Game Overview

Connect Four is a two-player strategy game where players take turns dropping discs into a grid. The first player to connect four of their discs horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins the game.

This project features:

- 🧠 **AI Opponent** powered by Minimax + Alpha-Beta pruning  
- 🖼️ **Graphical Interface** developed with `pygame`  
- 🎥 **Tutorial video** included to demonstrate features  
- 🧑‍💻 Built in **Python**, beginner-friendly and open for contributions

## 🧠 AI Implementation

- **Minimax Algorithm**: Explores all possible future game states up to a fixed depth to decide the optimal move.
- **Alpha-Beta Pruning**: Speeds up decision-making by cutting off paths that won’t be chosen.
